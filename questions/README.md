## About the task

Please write code to deliver a solution to **only one** of the three requirements outlined below. We have provided three possible problems for you to focus on, please select only one to complete. We appreciate that your time is valuable and do not expect any of these exercises to take any more than 90 minutes.

If you think these will take longer than that, I strongly encourage you to please get in touch with the recruiter you are engaged with to ask any clarifying questions.

## Submission guidelines

### Do

- Provide a instructions in text or markdown format that provides a concise way to setup and run the provided solution. 
- Take the time to read any applicable API or service docs, it may save you significant effort 
- Make your solution simple and clear. We aren't looking for overly complex ways to solve the problem since in our experience simple, clear solutions to problems are also generally the most maintainable and extensible solutions.  
- Clone this repo and create a branch using your full name prefixed with solution, e.g. git checkout -b solution-jack-brown, once you code is complete push up your soliution to the repo

### Don't 

- Expect the reviewer to dedicate a machine for the purpose of reviewing the test by
- Installing software globally that may conflict with system software
- Requiring changes to system wide configurations
- Provide overly complex solutions that need to spin up a ton of unneeded supporting dependencies. We aspire to keeping our dev experiences as simple as possible (but no simpler)!
- Include identifying information in your submission. We are endeavouring to make our review process anonymous.

## Exercises

These problems are not particularly difficult but do vary. It’s up to you which one you choose to spend your time on. Please don't submit a solution for more than one exercise.
If you have any questions we encourage you to get in touch and we’ll answer as soon as possible.

### Github API

Using a general purpose programming language (not Bash/PowerShell), write a script that uses the Github API to query a user’s publicly available gists. When the script is first run, it should display a listing of all the user’s publicly available gists. On subsequent runs the script should list any gists that have been published since the last run. The script may optionally provide other functionality (possibly via additional command line flags) but the above functionality **must** be implemented.

### Mini Kube

Write a simple web based hello world application in any one of these languages: Python, Ruby, Javasript or PHP. Build the application within a Docker container and then load balance the application within Minikube. You are not required to automate the installation of Minikube on the host machine.

### Vagrant CI
Using a configuration management language of your choosing (Ansible, Puppet, Salt, Chef) setup a Continuous Integration server of your choosing on a Vagrant Box. You are not required to setup Vagrant or its requirements on the host machine.
